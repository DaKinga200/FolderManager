# FolderManager
This is a repository for a very very simple program for creating and deleting folders in Python. Just for practicing algorithmic and programming concepts.
The program is based of 2 scripts that executes the process for creating and deleting folders. These files are executed in the terminal and it takes in account the path where the action is done and multiple folder's creation/deletion.

Thanks for reading
